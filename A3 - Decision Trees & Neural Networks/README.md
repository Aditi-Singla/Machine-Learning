## Assignment 3 - Decision Trees and Neural Networks

This assignment involves implementation of Decision Trees (and Random Forests) algorithm for a forest covertype dataset and Neural Networks algorithm for the game of Connect-4. Statement for the same is linked [here](./Statement.pdf).

A detailed report with experimentation and results can be found [here](./Report.pdf).

#### Running the code

To run the algorithms -

- For q1 on decision trees,

  ```bash
  ./q1.sh <train-data> <validation-data> <test-data>
  ```

- For q1 on dtrees and random forests using scikit,

  ```bash
  python q1_scikit_dtrees.py <train-data> <test-data>
  python q1_scikit_forests.py <train-data> <test-data>
  ```

- For q2 on neural networks,

  ```bash
  python q2.py <train-data> <test-data>
  ```
