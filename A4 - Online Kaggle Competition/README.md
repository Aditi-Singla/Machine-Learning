## Assignment 4 - Online Kaggle Competition

This assignment involves experimentation with various learning algorithms on a real world dataset. For a given binary classification dataset with features extracted from audio-visual broadcast of news channels ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/col-774-spring-2017)), the task is to predict whether the broadcast is a commercial (+1) or non-commercial (-1). Statement for the same is linked [here](./Statement.pdf).

A detailed report about experimentation can be found [here](./Report.pdf). The consolidated experimentation results can be found [here](./report).
