## Assignment 2 - Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines

This assignment involves implementation of Naive Bayes algorithm for a text classification problem and SVM algorithm for a facial attractiveness classification problem. Statement for the same is linked [here](./Statement.pdf).

A detailed report with experimentation and results can be found [here](./Report.pdf).

#### Running the code

To run the algorithms -

- For q1 on naive bayes,

  ```bash
  python q1.py --train <train-data> --test <test-data>
  ```

- For q2 on SVMs,

  ```bash
  python q2.py <train-data> <train-labels> <test-data> <test-labels>
  ```
